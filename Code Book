This file contains the codebook of the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information. 
The R script run_analysis.R prepares the raw data for future analysis, the preparation follows 5 steps as described in the course project instructions.

Before the start: Dataset is downloaded, unzipped and read, and the dplyr package is activated. 
Then, every useful text file was read and assigned to a variable. e.g. activitylabels <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt")
Followed by 5 steps:
  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
          The datasets corresponding to test and train is merged for each variable X, Y and subject. 
          e.g. X <- rbind(xtrain, xtest); merged <- cbind(subject, X, Y)
  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
          The measurements on mean and std subsets in the "extracted" variable only of the columns "subject" and "code".
  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
          The code from the activity dataset is taken to name the activities in the extracted dataset.
  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
          The code column was replaced by the activities column and the descriptive variable names were renamed with an explicit name.
  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
          The extracted variable is grouped by subject and activity, then summarised by taking the mean of each variable, activity and subject and assgined to tidydata.
          A table of the tidydata is exported as a text file: "tidydata.txt"
