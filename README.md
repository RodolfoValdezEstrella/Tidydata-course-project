# Tidydata-course-project
This are the instructions to get the tidy data for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. 

The raw data is a zip file " https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip "

The code book indicates all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information. 
The R script contains the process of getting and cleaning data following the steps proposed: 
                                      Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
                                      Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
                                      Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
                                      Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
                                      From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
And the Tidy Data text file "tidydata.txt" contains the final tidy data after running the R script.
